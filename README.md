## 🌱 Background  

Managing personal finances as a university student can be challenging. Between keeping track of spending, remembering who owes you money, and splitting bills with friends, it’s easy to lose track.  

**FINANCIA** was born from that exact problem — built as a practical and intuitive solution for students to take full control of their finances.  
With a clean interface and data-driven insights, this project helps students stay organized and financially aware in their daily lives.
